- Germany JobCenter/Ministery can takeover and finance the idea
 -> It's about people in a risky situation to get unemployed

- Pivot Idea?
    - Platform cannot allocate interested people to interesting projects 
    - How can the community help to priorize jobs
    - Person with skillsets, rating system
    - Allocations: Aldi, MC Donalds, ... weight in Upvoting, Downvoting
    
- Pivot Idea?
    - Problem: People are still emplyoed but employers cannot pay them in the next year? How can you **keep people employed**
    - Fix current issue in the job market
    
- What algorithms would do the matching between employers and employees?
    - What do you want to match?
    - Which factors are relevant? (e.G. Salesmen only for Salesmen-Jobs)
    - Matching People vs Matching Teams
    - *first prototype shouldnt go to far into these details*
    - whats a simple way to match?
    - Num People / Timeframe / location
    - Breaking down some skills? 
    - Where is most demand
    - keept it simple
    - Example:
        - tourism agency

        - staff of big hotel -> goes to ski resort in off season

- voting for ressources with money?
    - bidding system?
- not another profit maximization scheme
- non profit organization for this project?
- difference between us and cooper:
    - criteria -> we are looking for the companies which are most in trouble
- to fulfill all needs shoudl not be our job -> market solves it
- financing / monetary aspect:
    - jobcenter pays us or germany
    - percent of each transaction
    - shouldnt invest time in this topic

- stock market solves need / demand problem
    - maximises transaction volume
- target group?
    - employees vs employers
- focus on companies?
    - later add interface for people
    - individual people is complicated in germany
    - bodyleasing is legal in germany
        - company needs to do paperwork with their employees
        - we'll digitalize it
    - sme companies (Small and medium-sized enterprises)
- focus on easy level skills
    - key skills needed
    - level those skills up -> app and match 
    - we shouldnt do this?
    - comparing is not allowed
        - some things are not allowed

*Focus on SME is decided*

- is there an existing platform for bodyleasing agencies?

- platform for lending employees to each other
    - only platform not a middle company
    - contract is between 2 companies not platform
- need precise language for people to understand our mission
